⚙️ Setup & Usage
You don’t need Node.js or npm for this project.
Just open the HTML file directly in your browser.
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/sausan07/project-website-portfolio-sausan-250458302058.git

2. Navigate to the Project Folder
cd portofolio-tailwind

3. Open the Website

🌐 Tailwind CSS via CDN
This project uses the official Tailwind CSS CDN for styling.
In each HTML file, Tailwind is imported through the following script inside the <head> tag:

<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>

You can also customize Tailwind directly in the HTML file using a script block like this:

<script>
  tailwind.config = {
    theme: {
      extend: {
        colors: {
          primary: '#a3c9a8',
          secondary: '#fef9ef',
        },
      },
    },
  }
</script>

This method is ideal for quick styling and experimentation without installing dependencies.
